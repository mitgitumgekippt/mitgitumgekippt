## Hey 👋 What's up?

My name is Moritz and I'm a computer science graduate, from Trier, Germany!

## About me

###

**Creating bugs since** 2016<br>
**I'm currently learning** Go and about vulnerabilities in Rust<br>
**I’m currently working on** my VPS (which is mainly for simplifying my life) and some [blog posts](https://moritz-mander.de/)<br>
**Fun fact:** I once found gold in a forrest close to Melbourne (Australia). It's as big as a rice corn and thus not enough for early retirement...
